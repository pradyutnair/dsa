The price of a property is calculated by multiplying the size by the square-meter price of the location. E.g., a property of size 100 with a square-meter price of 1000, costs 100,000. These two classes have already been implemented according to the given specifications. This calculation is done by a method `price()`.\n",

To calculate the price of a house, to the size is added one-fourth of the size of the garden. E.g., if the size of a house is 100 and there is a garden of size 50, with a square-meter price of 1000, the price is 112,500. For the class `House`, you have to implement the methods `__init__()`, `price()`, and `__repr__()`.    \n",

Lower the price of the castle by 0.02% for every day that it is for sale, with a maximum of 1000 days for sale (after 1000 days, the price is not lowered further).
