    "In this exercise, you create a function that determines whether a number is \"perfect.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Context</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. A \"proper divisor\" is any positive integer which is lower than the given number, which divides the given number without remainder. For instance, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. As 1+2+3=6, 6 is a perfect number. The proper divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12. 1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36, therefore 24 is not a perfect number. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `perfect()` is given an integer as parameter, and returns `True` if the integer is a perfect number, and `False` otherwise. You may assume that the function is called with an integer which is greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main()` function calls the function `perfect()` with all the integers between 1 and 10,000. There are four perfect numbers in that range. The first three are 6, 28, and 496. The fourth one you may discover by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "While testing, it may be smart to let the test loop only run up to 500, to reduce the time needed for the search. Once you can find the first three numbers, increase the number of trials to 10,000 again.\n",

    "The function `build_coauthors_dictionary()` gets one parameter, which is the name of a file. This file contains, on each line, the title of a paper, several names of authors, and finally a number which indicates how many times the paper has been cited. There are commas between each of the items.

The number of authors varies between the lines, but there is at least one author per paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the file to build a dictionary of authors and their coauthors. The keys are the author names, and the values are lists of coauthors in alphabetical order. So, for each author you need to create a sorted list containing all of the coauthor names in alphabetical order, and without repetition. You may assume that the file only contains lines which are as described above.

    "In this exercise you add items to a shopping basket and calculate the final price of the whole basket.\n",

    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The template file for this exercise contains four classes:  `Basket`, `Item`, `WeightedItem`, and `UnitsItem`. In the exercise you need to implement the class `Basket`, and the two item classes `WeightedItem` and `UnitsItem` which inherit from `Item`. The `Item` class is already complete and should not be changed. A UML diagram can be found in the exam's description file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`WeightedItem` is used for products with prices calculated by weights, like rice or beans. Objects of this class have a name and the price per kilogram. The method `calculate_price()` receives as argument the amount in grams and will return the price of the total amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "`UnitsItem` is used for products with prices calculated by units, like eggs or bread buns. Objects of this class have a name and the price per unit. The method `calculate_price()` receives as argument the number of units and will return the price of the total amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `Basket` class you need to implement three methods: `__init__()`, `add_item()`, and `create_receipt()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of the classes `WeightedItem` and `UnitsItem` can be added to a `Basket`. For this, you need to implement the `add_item()` method in the `Basket` class. The method receives an item and an amount. The amount should correspond to the kind of object, so the number of units or grams. You may decide for yourself how you keep track of the items in the basket. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total price of all the items in the basket is calculated using the `create_receipt()` method. This method has to create a string containing lines (separated by `\"\\n\"`). Each line must contain the item name, amount in the basket, and the total price. Every item should only be once on the receipt, so if you first add two buns to the basket, and later add another three buns to the basket, on the receipt there should be only one line with buns, namely five buns. \n",

    "A ring is a double-linked list in which the last node loops back to the first one. In this exercise you implement a method to insert nodes into a ring maintaining the numerical order.\n",

    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise uses the `Ring` class which you had to create in the December exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a double-linked list. Normally, such a list has a head and a tail, and the double-linked list itself has references to that head and tail. A \"ring\" is a double-linked list, in which the head's \"previous node\" refers to the tail, and the tail's \"next node\" refers to the head. The ring has a reference to one of the nodes, which is called the current node. A schematic representation of a ring with four nodes is given on the next page. The code for the exercise contains a Ring class, which implements a ring consisting of RingNodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ring has five methods (all of which are implemented already):<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>`__init__()` which creates the ring</li>\n",
    "<li>`__len__()` which ensure that when you ask for the length of the ring using the len() function it gives you the number of nodes in the ring</li>\n",
    "<li>`add()` which adds a node to the ring. The value for the new node is given as parameter. The new node has the current node as nextnode, and after insertion of the new node, the new node is the current node.</li>\n",
    "<li>`rotate()` which rotates the ring by moving the current node a number of steps, given as a parameter. If steps is positive, the current node is moved to the nextnode for the given number of steps. If steps is negative, the ring rotates in the opposite direction by following the prevnode references.</li>\n",
    "<li>`__repr__()` which returns a string which represents the ring, showing the values stored in the ring starting with the current node.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to implement a `SortedRing` class, which inherits from `Ring`. An UML diagram is shown in the PDF for the exam. You override the `add()` method so that when you add a node to a `SortedRing`, it is placed in the ring so that the ordering of the values is preserved. E.g., if a sorted ring contains nodes with values 3, 6, and 7 (in that order, whereby the node with value 7 points to the node with value 3 as next node), and you add the value 5, the new node is inserted between the node with value 3 and the node with value 6. After insertion of a new node, the current node is this new node.\n",

    "You may assume that the `SortedRing` will be created with only integer values.â€ƒ\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible way of solving this exercise is by letting the `add()` method of `SortedRing` rotate the ring until the current node is the place where the new value must be inserted, and then use the `add()` of `Ring` to insert the new node. \n",

    "In this exercise you determine the time complexity of five functions which determine whether or not the letters in a word appear in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the functions, which are all named `ascending_x()` (`x` being a number), gets one parameter: a string which is a word. The function returns `True` if all the letters in the word appear in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the functions, write as a comment in the file what the time complexity is (immediately below the function), and give a brief explanation on how you determined this. If you do not add an explanation, the answer is automatically considered to be wrong. In your big-O notation of the time complexity, you may use `n` to refer to the length of the word.\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Making a copy of a string is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string</li>\n",

    "<li>The `range()` iterator is `O(1)`</li>\n",
    "<li>The function `len()` is `O(1)`</li>\n",
    "<li>The list method `sort()` for a list of length `n` is `O(n*log(n))`</li>\n",
    "<li>The string method `join()` with a list of length `n` as argument is `O(n)`</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are descriptions of the algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>`ascending_1()` compares every letter of the word to the next one.</li>\n",
    "<li>`ascending_2()` compares every letter of the word with all the letters in the part of the word which comes after that letter.</li>\n",
    "<li>`ascending_3()` turns the word into a list, sorts the list, and then compares the sorted list with the original list of letters.</li>\n",
    "<li>`ascending_4()` turns the word into a list, then compares each letter with the next and swaps them if they are not in ascending order; after that it turns the new list into a string again and compares it with the original word.</li>\n",
    "<li>`ascending_5()` recursively checks whether the first letter of a word is lower than the first letter of the rest of the word, and if the rest of the word is also in ascending order.</li>\n",
