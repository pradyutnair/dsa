    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to express the number <i>e</i> (Euler’s constant), which is 2.718281828459... One way is the following formula, which has an infinite number of fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`e = 2 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 2/(3 + 3/(4 + 4/(5 + 5/…)))))`\n",

    "Recursively, you can express this as: `e = 2 + 1/cf(1)`\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `approximate_e()` which calculates the value of <i>e</i> using the formula given above. The function gets one parameter, which is the depth of the calculation (an integer valued zero or higher), i.e., the number of fractions that you include in the calculation. At the given depth, you approximate `cf(n)` by `n+1`. The function returns a float, which is the approximation of <i>e</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "At depth 0, you approximate `cf(1)` as `1+1`, thus <i>e</i> is approximated by `2 + 1/(1+1) = 2.5`\n",
    "\n",
    "At depth 1, you approximate `cf(2)` as `2+1`, and `cf(1)=1+1/cf(2)`, thus <i>e</i> is approximated by `2 + 1/(1+1/(2+1)) = 2.75`\n",

There are three possible values for `request` (for which there are constants in the template file) namely \"add\", \"remove\", and \"list\". There are two possible values for `priority` (also represented by constants in the template file), namely \"low\" and \"high\".\n",

If the priority is \"high\", you add the job to the start of the linked list. The method returns a string \"added: \" plus the job (see the example below). Note that when a high-priority job is added to the list, you can just attach it to the head –- you do not have to insert it after all other high-priority jobs. Therefore you do not need to store the priority with a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `request` is \"remove\", you remove one job from the list, namely the one at the start. The method returns a string \"removed: \" plus the job that was removed (see the example below). If there were no jobs in the list, the method only returns the string: \"removed: Nothing\".\n",

    "<b>Exercise description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The template for this exercise contains a class `Data`. When a `Data` object is created, you give it a `filename` (string). The class has two methods which you need to create: `parseFile()` and `search()`. You are allowed to make changes to the `__init__()` method, and to add extra methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "`parseFile()` is called once, and pre-processes the file. It gets no parameters. It returns `False` if the file does not exist, otherwise it returns `True` (you do not need to check for exceptions). The preprocessing should make sure that you can search the file contents for words, consisting of letters from the alphabet. The letters can be upper-case or lower-case, and the search should be case-sensitive (so distinguish between upper-case and lower-case). `The parseFile()` method should have a time complexity which is at worst `O(n*log(n))`, with `n` being the number of separate words that can be found in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `parseFile()` has been called, you can search for words (which only consist of letters from the alphabet). You do this with the `search()` method. This method gets the `target` (string) that you are searching for as parameter. It returns `True` if the target can be found, and otherwise `False`. The search should be at worst `O(log(n))`, with `n` being the number of separate words that can be found in the file.\n",
