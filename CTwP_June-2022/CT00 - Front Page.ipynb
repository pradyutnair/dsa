    "The course consists of a small number of reasonably short chapters, most of which lay out one concept in computational thinking which directly translates to solving programming problems. The goal is for students to study the concepts, and then, when they encounter programming problems, consider which concepts apply. In time, these concepts should become second nature. The course is mainly meant for students who are still struggling with *how* to approach new programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exercises in the chapters, but these are not sufficient to train. Rather, *any* programming problem can be used to train with computational thinking. So the training should happen automatically when a student is programming."
