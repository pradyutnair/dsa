    "At the end of the previous chapter I showed how you can create a function that solves a task in a more general way than for the specific case that was required to solve the particular problem that you have at hand. A typical application of functions (and other programming concepts, but in this course the focus is on functions) is to generalise over multiple problems which need the same or very similar solutions. While seldom needed for smaller problems, it can be helpful to gain a \"feel\" for programming to think about how you can solve a problem in a more generalised way."

    "We talk about abstraction when refering to the common attributes of a group of entities which we deal with in a program. For instance, when we have a program that deals with creating identification cards for the people who have an affiliation with a university, that program only needs to know of a person their administration number, their first name, and their last name, because it only needs to know these features to create a card. Of course, persons are much more than those three features, but for the program an abstraction of a person is an entity which only has these three features. As long as an entity is given to the program which has the features of this abstraction of a person, it can create a card for the entity.\n",

Maybe in the past there was a separate program for creating cards for students and for creating cards for staff members, but since students and staff members have the features of the same, abstract person, one program is all that is necessary. You can say that the program has generalised over persons' roles.\n",

Once you study object orientation, however, you may encounter the notion of \"abstract classes,\" which are entities in a program which are never instantiated by themselves, but which can be implemented by more specified classes. I will not say more about it here, as it will come up when you get to object orientation."
