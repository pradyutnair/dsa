    "You know that when you read a file, you can either get a string or a list of strings. Which of these two would be most appropriate for the present problem? A list of strings is mainly useful if you need to do something with the separate lines in the file, but the lines are not important for the current problem. So a string suffices. So, let's decide to represent the contents of the file as a string.\n",

The three basic data structures in Python which have this are the list, the dictionary, and the set. Since we have to store a count with each word, we have the following main possibilities:\n",

Searching for a word in a list is slow (if you do not know why, check out a lecture on time complexity), while for a dictionary it is fast. \n",

    "A set of tuples won't work, but you have to know a bit about sets to realize why not. Suppose that I have in my set stored that the word \"you\" occurs twice; that would entail that according to my description, (\"you\",2) is an element of the set. I find the word \"you\" once more in the file contents, so I have to *remove* the item (\"you\",2) from the set, and *add* the item (\"you\",3). But I do not actually *know* that (\"you\",2) is in the set. So I have to search the whole set to see if somewhere there is an item in the set which has \"you\" as the first element of the item -- if I find it, I can read the second element, remove the item, and add a new item with 1 added to the second element; otherwise I add (\"you\",1) to the set. Really, if I am going to jump through such hoops, I better just use a list.\n",

    "You may wonder whether the code we produced for the problem is too convoluted. Besides the basic function `get_word_with_highest_count()` that we needed to implement, we implemented six other functions. Two of these only have one line of code, and one has two lines of code. All the functions are very simple and straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer is that, yes, I think the code is a bit too convoluted the way it is written now. Having so many small functions does not make the code more readable. However, as an illustration of problem decomposition I think this works well: you can actually *see* that solving a bigger, fairly hard problem can be accomplished by solving six small, easy problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, however, for this problem I would probably keep the function `stringclean()` as a separate function (as it was copied from somewhere else), but leave the rest of the code in the function `get_word_with_highest_count()`, perhaps with some comments in between the different steps of the flow diagram. The code would then look like this:"

    "\n",
    "Several issues were not dealt with in the program developed in this chapter. One issue is what you will do when the file cannot be found. In that case, the program should return the word \"Error\". Another is that there may be more than one word which occurs the most. In that case, the program should return of those possible answers the word that is earliest in the alphabet. Identify in which steps you will have to take care of these issues, and adapt the program accordingly. Note that one of the advantages of a good decomposition is that it isn't hard to find where an adaptation must be made.\n",

    "### Exercise 5.2\n",
    "\n",
    "When you count how often words occur in a file, you will find that some words occur only once, some words occur twice, some words occur three times, etc. Design and implement a function which returns how many words in a file occur only once. You probably realize that you can reuse most of the code which is given in the chapter; you only need to adapt the last step a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5.3*\n",
    "\n",
    "In continuation of the previous exercise, design and implement a function which returns which wordcount occurs least often for a file. For instance, supposed that 5 words occur once, 3 words occur twice, 6 words occur three times, and 2 words occur four times, then the function returns 4, as the wordcount that occurs the least is 4 (namely it occurs for only 2 words). If you base this function on the code that was developed in this chapter, you will have to redesign the final step of the code. Do this with a flow diagram before implementing it. You may want to build a new data structure from the dictionary `wordcounts` in your solution.\n",

    "Take a number. If the number is even, divide it by 2, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the procedure with the new number. Continue repeating the procedure until you reach 1. E.g., if you start with 10, you divide by 2 to get 5. You multiply by 3 and add 1, which gives 16. 16 gets divided by 2 which gives 8. 8 gets divided by 2 which gives 4. 4 gets divided by 2 which gives 2. 2 gets divided by 2 which gives 1. The procedure was executes 6 times, namely 5 times dividing by 2, and once multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gollatz Conjecture says that this procedure will inevitably lead to 1. While the Conjecture is not proven yet, it has been checked up to numbers of 19 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a function which gets a number as input and returns how often the procedure was executed before 1 was reached. Start by making a flow diagram which represents a task decomposition. If you can implement such tasks immediately, do so. Otherwise, make a further decomposition before you start implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5.5**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Hangman game, you have to guess a word. You do this by guessing letters. The word is displayed as dashes for each letter, where a dash is replaced by the correct letter when you have guessed it. For instance, the word `PROGRAMMING` would be displayed as `-----------` as long as you have not guessed any letters, but when you have guessed R, it is displayed as `-R--R------`, and if you then guess M, it is displayed as `-R--R-MM---`. When guessing letters, a \"fail\" means that you guess a letter which is not in the word. You have a limited number of fails available before you lose the game. You win if you guess the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Hangman program in which the computer controls the game. The computer selects a word, and lets the human player make guesses. The game ends with a win for the human when the word is completed, or with a loss for the human when there are 10 fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a Hangman program. Start with a high-level flow diagram. Each of the steps in the flow diagram is a task, and the flow diagram represents the problem decomposition. If for a task you can easily implement an algorithm, program it. If not, make a further decomposition of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have an initial version of the program working, you will probably see further improvements that you can make. For instance, if your implementation lets the computer select a word from a small list, you can let the computer select the word from a dictionary which is stored in a text file. If you allowed the human to repeat letters as guesses, you can build in a check for that. If you did not tell the human what the actual word was when the game ends in a loss, you should probably add that. You can let the human specify the length of the word before a word is selected. Etcetera. This probably means that some of the tasks you defined become more complex, and you may have to make a further decomposition of the task. However, you should note that if you made a good problem decomposition in the first place, you usually only need to make changes to a single task to add the new functionality."
