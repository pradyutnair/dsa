    "In the previous chapter I explained how you can use a top-down approach to quickly create a working program, which is not completed yet, and then fill in different functionalities as you further develop the program. Sometimes, however, a task is of such complexity that you cannot really distinguish different steps which you can implement separately. In such cases, a bottom-up approach might be more suited to solve the problem."

    "In bottom-up programming we recognize that a program consists of a simple task, embedded in a more complex task, which in its turn is embedded in an even more complex task, etc. While sometimes a top-down approach might still be used to tackle such a programming problem, it may make more sense to start implementing the simplest task first, and then \"work upward or outward.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a rather confusing explanation, an example may work to make clear what I mean by this. Suppose that you get the following programming problem: You roll six six-sided dice; you set all dice that show a six aside, and reroll the remaining dice; you continue doing this until all dice show a six. Estimate, using a simulation, how many rolls you need to make all dice show a six.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is actually not that hard to imagine how you do this as a human. You would take six dice, and begin rolling, setting aside all sixes until all dice show six. You write down how many rolls you needed. You then repeat the process a large number of times, each time writing down the number of rolls needed. When you think you have gathered enough rolls, you add them all up and divide by the number of trials. This is a boring task, but that is why we have a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about this procedure, you may recognize that it consists of a number of nested loops. The outermost loop is the loop which controls the trials. In there you have a loop which controls the rerolls of the remaining dice. In there you have a loop which rolls each separate die, and keeps track of the dice that show a six. \n",
    "\n",
    "An experienced programmer may see no issues here and immediately code the whole procedure, but for an inexperienced programmer this is harder. A top-down approach would start at the outer loop, but it only makes sense to create that outer loop when you have code for the tasks that are in it. In this case, if you want to handle the problem step by step, you may want to start with the innermost task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I am not saying that a top-down approach couldn't work here, but for inexperienced programmers it is helpful if you can immediately see that a task that you implemented is doing what it should do, and for a nested loop it is not easy to see that the outer loop is doing what it is supposed to do without having access to the inner loops."
