    "The point I wanted to make in the previous chapter is that you are able to think computationally, to design algorithms, because you do it all the time. However, as a human you have the ability to adapt your algorithms on the fly if they are faulty. That is called \"improvisation,\" which, by the way, is also a form of computational thinking. Because of your ability to improvise, there is no need for you to really think carefully about the algorithms you use in your daily life. This is different for computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm for a computer must be precise. It must be complete. It must be able to deal with any unforeseen circumstance, otherwise the algorithm will not reach its legitimate end and thus will not produce the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages have been created to allow you to specify algorithms in a way that a computer can understand them. It is up to you, the programmer, to ensure that the algorithms that you present the computer with are indeed able to achieve the result that you want them to reach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter I will discuss the everyday task of sorting things, which is something that you occasionally need to do and for which you usually think a bit on how to do it most efficiently. This kind of thinking is also needed when writing computer programs. I will start, however, with a discussion of pseudo code, which can be an intermediate step between thinking about an algorithm and implementing it into code."

    "This course assumes that you can code in Python (even if you are not strong at designing algorithms with Python). So you can write program code. Writing pseudo code is a lot like writing program code, except that in pseudo code you can take \"shortcuts.\" Your code does not need to be able to run. It just must give a good, preferably unambiguous insight in what a program should look like. A programmer should be able to turn the pseudo code into a program in any computer language that would be suitable for implementing the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, in pseudo code you will be explicit about certain code elements which you would not need to be explicit about in your chosen programming language. For instance, in Python, if I want to create a variable, I just introduce the variable name and assign an initial value to it, e.g., `num = 0` creates a variable `num` which is a numerical variable, as a numerical value was assigned to it. In other programming languages variables have to be declared with a specific type before you can assign them a value. Therefore, someone who knows C++ but not Python might protest when they see a statement in pseudo code that just says `num = 0`, because in the eyes of this person the algorithm does not know that `num` is supposed to be an integer. Therefore, in pseudo code you would probably write `int num = 0`, to make explicit that num is a variable of the integer type, which can be used from the moment it has been declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that you will often see in pseudo code is that code \"blocks\" are started with a curly starting bracket and closed with a curly closing bracket. The indentation of a code block would still be like it is in Python (as that is the most readable), but the curly brackets are there to make explicit that the statements within belong to a code block, as most programming languages are not as picky as Python about indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in pseudo code statements are often ended with a semi-colon, as that is common in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of writing pseudo code is that you are allowed to be fairly \"loose\" in what you write. For instance, if in a statement you want to sort a list of persons with the name `personlist` by last name, followed by first name, you can just write `sort personlist by lastname, firstname` without being more specific on how you actually implement that.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the shopping list examples of the previous chapter are probably not suitable for pseudo code, considering that you will not implement them in actually program code, I could write a program in pseudo code for the flow diagrams that I gave. For instance, for the first flow diagram (Figure 2.1), the pseudo code is:\n"

    "I will now give an example of a real-life task for which you will actually design an algorithm when you encounter it. Suppose that you have several boxes of books, and an empty bookcase. You are going to place the books on the shelves of the bookcase, and want to have them on the shelves in a particular order, for instance alphabetically. A situation like this may occur when you are moving houses. Ordering books on shelves is not something that you do every day, so you may not have an algorithm for it ready that you apply without thinking. So, how will you do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you want to order the books on the shelves by the last name of the author. A straightforward approach is that you begin by placing the first book on the top-left position of the top shelf, and every next book that you take you insert in its correct spot between the books that you have already placed. While this works, you will be constantly shifting books on shelves, as shelves fill up and you have to make room for new books.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly more complex approach is that you assign each shelf a range of letters, which are the first letters of the author names. For instance, the top shelf A-D (\"Aafjes\"-\"Dyson\"), the second shelf E-H, the third shelf I-L, etc. You then do the same as in the first approach, except that you place the books on the shelf where the author belongs. This will result in a lot less shifting of books. The disadvantage of the approach is that you probably are going to end up with some shelves that do not fill completely, while other shelves get overly full and you will have to reassign letters during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third approach, if you have the space, is that you first sort the books in piles by the first letter of the author's last name. Thus you end up with about 26 piles of books on the floor. You then handle each pile separately, starting with the pile of authors whose name starts with an A. If a pile seems to be too big to handle in one go, you may repeat the process for that pile, for instance by splitting it into two or more smaller piles based on the second letter of the author's last name."

I will not discuss the formal approach to determine time complexity here, but will simply use the loose definition of \"counting looks at cards,\" which suffices for the purposes of this chapter.\n",

    "One way of sorting the deck would be to simply search the whole deck from to to bottom to find the first card, which would be the 2 of Diamonds. Once you have found the card, you put it aside, and search the deck for the next card, which would be the 3 of Diamonds. Once you have found it, you put it on top (or bottom, depending on how you are working) of the 2 of Diamonds. Then you search for the 4 of Diamonds, then the 5 of Diamonds, etc. You do this until you have sorted the deck.\n",

If, after shuffling, the deck was already sorted, you only need to look at 52 cards, because every time you search for a card, it will be the first one you look at. This is the \"best-case\" scenario.\n",

For sorting the deck of cards, we knew which was the next card that we were looking for, and thus could stop searching when we found that card. However, if some cards would be missing from the deck, a sorting algorithm which would search for a specific card would not give the desired result. So it may be preferable to search for the \"lowest\" of the remaining cards rather than a specific card, but that would mean that for each pass through the deck, you would have to look at every card, and this would need the worst-case number of looks.\n",

Since the algorithm you come up with would be used by a computer, it does not matter if it is boring or time-intensive, because we have computers to do the boring and time-intensive things for us.
